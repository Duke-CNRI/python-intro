# python-intro

These resources are used in the teaching of the class _Introduction to Python Programming for Experimental Design_ at Duke University for the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Program (CNRI) program. Our class was specifically designed around teaching and using `Python` to build behavioral experiments in `PsychoPy`. 

### Table of contents

**Class 1: Introduction to computer programming, the purpose of this class, variables, and datatypes**
- Introduce syllabus and goals of the class
- Introduce why scientist use computer programming, what it allows us to do and how we will use it in this class
- Formally introduce setting variables and different datatypes of variables (string, integers, and floats), Booleans, and the concept of evaluations

**Class 2: Introduction to control flow: conditionality and loops** 
- Introduce conditionality, the concept of control flow, and why it's useful!
- Introduce loops and iterators
- Build familiarity with Python syntax, indentation, interactions with variables
 
**Class 3: Building our own functions**
- Introduce functions and why we might want them
- Continue to build familiarity with Python syntax, focusing on function creation
- Create our own function and learn how to interact with them!

**Class 4: Building experimental blocks, functions/methods (brief mention of classes/objects)**
- Introduce methods, how they are both similar and different to functions
- Briefly mention concepts of classes and objects (that we will touch on again in the next class) 

**Class 5: Libraries and packages and a formal introduction to PsychoPy**
- Review the concepts of classes and objects, move to introducing libraries and packages
- Why are libraries really cool and how do we use them? 
- Introduce PsychoPy and how to search for and read package documentation.

**Class 6: Create stimuli, randomization/counterbalancing**
- Introduce specific methods in PsychoPy for creating stimuli and displaying them to screen
- Introduce NumPy and how we can randomize our stimuli (plus why it's important to do so). 

**Class 7: Collecting and storing responses**
- Introduce specific methods in PsychoPy for collecting keyboard responses, how to store those responses momentarily and how to store them "long term". 
- Introduce Pandas and how to save/export data. 

**Class 8: User Testing + debugging**
- Explore how we address errors in our code
- Introduce process of debugging: when our code runs but doesn't produce what we expect
- Introduce the debugging tools, e.g., simulated data

**Class 9 - 12: Building first experiment**
- Goal: to extend or replicate a prior finding from a behavioral study read during the semester
- Start with experimental proposal that includes detailed sketch of control flow of experiment, control flow timing, and associated variables/stimuli
- Class 9: collect and create stimuli needed, create all display screens (fixation cross, feedback screens, instruction screens, etc.)
- Class 10: Set up any conditionality and create trial for loop
- Class 11: Set up data collection and storage system
- Class 12: Debugging and user testing on fellow cohort mates

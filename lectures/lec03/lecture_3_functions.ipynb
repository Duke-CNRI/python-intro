Not only is this a lot of duplicate code, but it leads to another problem: if we have so much code inside our `for` loop, it is difficult to figure out what the loop is for without reading every single line of code, considering how each stimulus is drawn on the screen, how responses are recorded, etc. It is much better to have your task programmed something like this:\n",

    "In addition to being much shorter, this is easier to read because it **abstracts** the unnecessary details away from loop.

    "Finally, functions are great because Python already has functions for so many things you need to do, and these existing functions will almost always be faster and more memory efficient than whatever code you could work out in a day or two. Efficiency is a source of pride for software developers, and so they spend a *lot* (really, a lot) of time making their code as efficient as possible. So why bother trying to write code yourself when better, faster code is already out there?\n",

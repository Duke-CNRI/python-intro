    "As we saw in the previous lecture, `functions` are super great -- they can help us reduce our code duplication, keep our code clean and easy to read, and can be more efficient to run!\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't have the chance to touch on `methods`, so here is a QUICK quick explanation: `methods` are functions that are specific to (or _belong to_) a particular `class`. For example the method `append` _belongs to_ the class of `lists` and its functional use is limited/restricted to `lists`. You've run into these before, without us telling you their name: for instance, lists have lots of `methods`, but if we try to apply those methods to a string they might not work!"

    "I mentioned that functions are class-specific, but we haven't really talked about what classes are. So:\n",
    "**What exactly is a class?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, `classes` are like templates that help us build things (usually called `objects` when talking about the general thing being built or an `instance` when referring to a specific moment of a thing being built).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use classes? Why not just build functions forever? Without getting too much into the nitty gritty, classes help keep our code and programming _even_ lighter and more flexible. Basically, classes help us package code into discrete chunks (often called `modules`) that keep the details hidden away, allowing for easy-to-read (abstract), \"clean\" code. \n",
    "Technically, everything we've used so far (outside of functions) is a class! Lists are a class, floats are a class, strings are a class.....classes are central to everything that we do in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of code gets \"packaged into discrete chunks\"? When we think about creating a template, we typically want to think about _what_ is going into that template and _how_ we want it to work together. This might feel a bit too abstract so...\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, I am creating a template to make a cat (maybe I'm making a video game to test how fast people approach cats???)\n",
    "\n",
    "If I'm creating this template, I might think about _what features of a cat do I want to include here_. \n",
    "\n",
    "I might want to include:\n",
    "- The color of the cat\n",
    "- The size\n",
    "- What their name is\n",
    "- What their nickname is\n",
    "\n",
    "These are called `attributes`! And we can add them into our class similarly to how you add arguments in functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, color, size, name, nickname):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To set attributes in classes, we use `def __init__` which _constructs_ our object. To that constructor, we add the `self` (the specific instances we're creating -- this will make more sense later) and all of our `attributes` much like arguments in functions. We then add these attributes to the self (like assigning these attributes to that specific...cat). \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, color, size, name, nickname):\n",
    "    self.color = color\n",
    "    self.size = size\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.nickname = nickname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what's going on inside every class we've used so far, at the core of their templates. To actually create *instances* of these classes, we need to run that init function. To do this in the case of 'Cat', we'd run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "newCat = Cat(color, size, name, nickname)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where color, size, name, and nickname are all variables we'd have to define earlier in our code. We've **implicitly** run similar lines many times in our code, when using our basic variables: \n",
    "\n",

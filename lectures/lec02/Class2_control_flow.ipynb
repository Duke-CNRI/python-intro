    "# Class 2: What is control flow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by Miles Martinez\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been writing code line-by-line. That's slow and annoying, especially when we want to do things multiple times (like if we have multiple trials in an experiment). Additionally, we might not want to run all of our code in each experiment - we might want certain stimuli to display in some experimental conditions, but not other. How can we do this in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, how do we **Control** the **Flow** of our experiments? There are two main tools we'd use: for loops and conditionals. We're going to cover conditionals first; these will let us **conditionally** run our code. Next, we're going to cover for loops; these will let us repeat sections of our code without having to write the code itself multiple times. If we have time, we'll cover while loops too -- these use structure from both for loops and conditional statements, so if you understand both of those, you'll be well on your way to while loops too!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "To learn about different ways to control the flow of our code: specifically, conditionals and for loops.\n",
    "Start to understand how we might create structure to tell our computers what we want them to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign Python project teams: please fill out [this when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?21494620-qqiFS) before we start! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes:\n",
    "- understand the **syntax** of different types of flow (if statements, for loops)\n",
    "- understand the reasons for using different types of flow\n",
    "- be able to construct if statements, for loops, and while loops on your own\n",
    "- understand where in our code we would WANT to put these different kinds of loops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework:\n",
    "- come up with a list of topics for your project! send them to us by class Tuesday"

    "Booleans can be either **True** or **False**; a conditional will execute if the Boolean is **True**, and won't if it is **False**.\n",

    "\n",
    "    do something else!\n",

    "\n",
    "So all we're telling the computer here is: If some condition in our code is true (maybe our participant answered a question correctly), run a certain segment of code. Otherwise, do something else!\n",
